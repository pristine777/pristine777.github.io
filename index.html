            Hi, Welcome to my Webpage. <br> <br>
            I am an electrical hardware engineer with an industrial experience of 4+ years in embedded systems design and PLC 
            system integration. I have been majorly working in Research & Design division for product development during my 
            professional career. I recently completed my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a major in controls systems from Missouri 
            University of Science and Technology. 
            This website includes the details of the projects (including guides / tutorials) that I have been working on as well as the skill set 
            I was able to develop as my career progresses. <br> <br>

        The objective of the project was to build an adaptive intelligence algorithm for a soccer agent 
        (soccer player) to score maximum goals. <br> <br>
        The motivation this project was an attempt to understand and observe autonomous learning, its implementation
        for training the agents through experience. This method is very primitive, however, this turns out to be very
        useful for building an understanding of the idea behind decision making based on real time environment or 
        dynamic situations. <br> <br>

        The objective of this project was to study the functionality of the Linear-Quadratic-Regulator
        based controller design for highly non-linear systems. The major hurdle in the implementation
        was the interpretation of the non-linear dynamics of the Quad-copter system. It included
        understanding the theory behind 3-Dimensional flight dynamics.
        The performance of the LQR controller is compared with the conventional PID controller to
        record the difference in performance. This project is the replication of the results
        (for course-work purposes) of an already published IEEE paper which has been cited in the
        project report. <br> <br>

        In the conventional PID controller, the controller gains are fixed for an operating point.
        In this project, a neural network is designed which determines the PID controller gains
        for every time step based on the current available output. This allows better control
        over the system output. <br> <br>
        This project is the replication of the results (for course-work purposes) of an already
        published IEEE paper which has been cited in the project report. <br>
        NOTE: I was not able to simulate all the conditions. The controlled response for a non-linear system failed.
        I have plans to re-write the code to simulate the non-linear system. <br> <br>

        FreeRTOS SCHEDULING: A LITERATURE REVIEW <br>
        This project was taken up as a part of the course-work which involved studying the
        scheduling scheme used by FreeRTOS Open Source community. The project involved
        understanding the method used for implementing the scheduler; discuss its merits
        over other scheduling schemes and comparing different performance parameters. <br>
        I had tried implementing the FreeRTOS scheduler for a project and the scheduler

        REAL TIME SCHEDULER DESIGN & PROGRAMMING IN AN ARM ENVIRONMENT <br>
        This was a group project to design a clock driven scheduler to allow execution of
        periodic tasks (with known execution time) in fixed order in every frame. The
        processor execution frame size is calculated based on the available set of jobs /
        tasks to execute. The scheduler is designed such that, based on the available free
        time in each frame, the frame size is either increased to accommodate the task or
        task is scheduled in the next frame. <br>

        PATH FINDING ROBOT USING ROBO-VISION <br>
        The aim of this project is to develop a path finding robot which is capable of
        avoiding obstacles by itself using a USB web-cam interface and an AT89C2051
        micro-controller. The images are captured from the camera in real time and are
        transferred to the computer for processing. MATLAB was used for image processing
        in order to determine obstacles using edge detection. Based on the image analysis,
        control commands were provided to the micro-controller on the robot through the
        RS-232 serial interface. This project was taken up as part of the Final year
        project during the Bachelor's Degree. <br>

        8051 MICRO-CONTROLLER BASED FIRE MONTIORING & CONTROL SYSTEM <br>
        This project was the final year project for my Diploma in Digital Electronics.
        The project involved programming the micro-controller in assembly language.
        8-channel thermocouple sensor array was used to measure temperature at 8 different
        locations. Once a fire is sensed by any channel of the thermocouple, the alarm for
        the respective channel was triggered and a control relay was activated. <br>
