        <h3>~: About Me :~</h3>
        <div>The knowledge of all things is possible. <br> Leonardo da Vinci <br> <br>
             Hello Everyone!!! Welcome to my Webpage <br> <br>
             By profession, I am an electrical engineer, however, I have always been curious about everything, <br>
             be it natural or man-made, be it existing or even if it is just a hypothesis. Curiosity of knowledge
             has always been driving me and guiding my actions. <br>
             Although, my interests drove me virtually everywhere, I was highly inspired by the idea of Robots <br>
             (from constructing to programming one) which motivated me to seek my career in Engineering. After
             completing my schooling, I started my career with a Diploma in Digital Electronics which further
             fueled my curiosity in electronics circuit design and I pursued my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics
             Engineering from Mumbai University. I completed my bachelor's degree in 2009 and my first Job was as
             a Design Engineer at the Tata Power Co. Ltd. Strategic Engineering Division. At work, my abilities
             grew exponentially and I gained a lot of experience in circuit design and product design. During my
             tenure at TATA Power SED, I rose from a Design Engineer to a Product Design Engineer and ultimately
             to an Executive Engineer. In 2013, I took a very strong and difficult decision to leave the company
             in order to enhance my career and pursue further knowledge in the field of Robotics. In Spring 2014,
             I started my Master's in Electrical Engineering with a major in controls systems from Missouri
             University of Science and Technology, Rolla, USA recognized for its education in diverse engineering
             fields. I completed my Master's in fall 2015. Currently I am trying to explore ways to utilize my
             education, knowledge and experience to build something useful. <br>
             I have gone through various experiences and up's and down's which has allowed me to reach a position
             where; now, I am confident to design a system on my own from scratch. <br> <br>
             This website is an attempt to organize various projects that I have worked on throughout my career,
             and to spread the knowledge I have gained, to anyone looking for some guidance with similar interests. <br>
             And yes, I have also shared some of my personal interests which provide me enough relaxation and help
             me be motivated on my quest for the search for knowledge.<br> <br>
             Have fun exploring my webpage. <br>
             If you have any suggestions / comments, post on my twitter handle.

        This project was an attempt to study the Q-learning algorithm, which is one of the most popularly
        known methods of reinforcement learning. The objective of the project was to build the
        intelligence for a soccer agent (soccer player) to score maximum goals. <br> <br>
        The motivation this project was an attempt to understand and see for real how the autonomous
        learning can be implemented for training the agents through experience. Although this method
        is very primitive, however, this turned to be very useful for me in understanding the idea
        behind decision making based on real time environment and dynamic situations. <br> <br>

        The goal behind this project was to study the functionality of the Linear-Quadratic-Regulator
        based controller design for highly non-linear systems. The major hurdle in the implementation
        was the interpretation of the non-linear dynamics of the Quad-copter system. It included
        understanding the theory behind 3-Dimensional flight dynamics. <br> <br>
        The performance of the LQR controller is compared with the conventional PID controller to
        record the difference in performance. This project is the replication of the results
        (for course-work purposes) of an already published IEEE paper which has been cited in the
        project report. <br> <br>

        In the conventional PID controller, the controller gains are fixed for an operating point.
        In this project, a neural network is designed which determines the PID controller gains
        for every time step based on the current available output. This allows better control
        over the system. <br> <br>
        This project is the replication of the results (for course-work purposes) of an already
        published IEEE paper which has been cited in the project report. I was not able to
        simulate all the conditions. The controlled response for a non-linear system failed.
        I have plans to re-write the code to simulate the non-linear system. <br> <br>

        FreeRTOS SCHEDULING: A LITERATURE REVIEW <br>
        This project was taken up as a part of the course-work which involved studying the
        scheduling scheme used by FreeRTOS Open Source community. The project involved
        understanding the method used for implementing the scheduler; discuss its merits
        over other scheduling schemes and comparing different performance parameters. <br>
        I had tried implementing the FreeRTOS scheduler for a project and the scheduler
        source code file is available as part of the documentation. This code might not
        be the most efficient, as it was the first time I have extensively written a
        program in embedded C. <br>

        REAL TIME SCHEDULER DESIGN & PROGRAMMING IN AN ARM ENVIRONMENT <br>
        This was a group project to design a clock driven scheduler to allow execution of
        periodic tasks (with known execution time) in fixed order in every frame. The
        processor execution frame size is calculated based on the available set of jobs /
        tasks to execute. The scheduler is designed such that, based on the available free
        time in each frame, the frame size is either increased to accommodate the task or
        task is scheduled in the next frame. <br>

        PATH FINDING ROBOT USING ROBO-VISION <br>
        The aim of this project is to develop a path finding robot which is capable of
        avoiding obstacles by itself using a USB web-cam interface and an AT89C2051
        micro-controller. The images are captured from the camera in real time and are
        transferred to the computer for processing. MATLAB was used for image processing
        in order to determine obstacles using edge detection. Based on the image analysis,
        control commands were provided to the micro-controller on the robot through the
        RS-232 serial interface. This project was taken up as part of the Final year
        project during the Bachelor's Degree. <br>
        No electronic documentation available for this project. <br> <br> <br>

        8051 MICRO-CONTROLLER BASED FIRE MONTIORING & CONTROL SYSTEM <br>
        This project was the final year project for my Diploma in Digital Electronics.
        The project involved programming the micro-controller in assembly language.
        8-channel thermocouple sensor array was used to measure temperature at 8 different
        locations. Once a fire is sensed by any channel of the thermocouple, the alarm for
        the respective channel was triggered and a control relay was activated. <br>

      I constantly keep up with the latest in gaming. More of FPS games than any other styles. My favorite genres
      being Action, Adventure, Shooter and Role Playing. I'd rather play as a character than handle a bunch of
      characters. But yes I'm all in for the classic SEGA and Nintendo games (or the so called TV video games). Well
      for now I'm waiting to get my hands on: <br> <br>

      Apart from my work and gaming I sometimes put myself in sketching. I need a true inspiration or strong
      motivational force to push me out off the routine to start sketching. I have recently started human
      figures. Still getting a hang of it and have a long way to go. You can have a look at few sketches from
      my complete collection below. <br> <br>
